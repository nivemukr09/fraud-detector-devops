# 🛡️ Insurance Claim Fraud Detector (DevOps Project)

This is a full-stack DevOps project that simulates a real-world **Insurance Claim Fraud Detection** system, powered by a machine learning model. It is fully containerized, CI/CD-enabled, and deployable on Kubernetes using ArgoCD and Helm.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

Insurance fraud costs billions each year. This project uses an ML model to classify insurance claims as either **fraudulent** or **legitimate** based on factors like:

- Claim amount
- Number of past accidents
- Age of the policyholder
- Claim type (vehicle, health, home)
- Region (north, south, east, west)

## 📦 Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.10
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- REST API with CORS enabled

### Machine Learning
- Logistic Regression
